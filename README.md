# iCu Discontinued, please use iCu X that also is a healthier replacement for 3uTools and more.
The ultimate legacy bypasser on Windows.

Bypass Tethered (Activation Lock, Hello Screen)

Jailbreak with Pangu7

Enter recovery mode

Install an older, fine-tuned iTunes + Driver for Legacy operation(s)

## Written Tutorial, Step-By-Step

Use the Install XAMPP in PrepTools

Wait for Download and install in default location

Go to C:\iCures and drag and drop sliver.php into the "htdocs shortcut"

Click run XAMPP and start everything

Use Bypass Tethered (x64), Both buttons work

If x64 bypass does not work use the x86 options

If you encounter issues with this report then directly via DM on reddit.

CB/X and CB/A buttons are for advanced users and have a written tutorial in the Programms files.

Legacy Tools module usage is self-explaining

If you get errors when closing XAMPP, thats expected and FINE!.

If you get errors while updating, you have no internet connection. This feature is extremely Fail-safe.

This tool will not work on forbidden territory, including but not limited to: Russia, North Korea

For help with error codes, visit our documentation website ONLY LIGHT MODE : https://iCu.uk.ms

## OTA Updates

iCu supports OTA Updates. Major releases get their own installers but all smaller updates are carried out OTA (Over-The-Air) Internet connection is needed to update the iCu software. All updates are advised to do and so is V24.0.0, the most important update yet. If you are STILL using V23.X.X that does not have an updater, DELETE it and reinstall an verion with an updater. No support is provided for unsupported verions, Debug it for yourself. Downgrading iCu will always be possible trough the Update Hub one its introduced, you will still need the .Zip of the target version. All major Updates will have installers present even when Unsupported.
