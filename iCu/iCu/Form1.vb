The CB/X Button is for running user-defined hosting scripts, as the default configuration tends to be troublesome for the majority of users
and i have recieved some hate about the tool not working, this is the answer to all of that, if it does not work, you can prove yourself better and execute your own magic here till i fix the tool.
The CB/A Button is comming to for custom activation scripts, too. The Programm is 100% open so you can fix the batch scripts anyway and the app too, feel free to contrib.

Defaults:

CB/X: C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe
CB/A: C:\iCures\idact.bat

Config files:

CB/X: C:\iCures\CB-X-config.txt
CB/A: C:\iCures\CB-A-config.txt

Explaination (in-depth) is at C:\iCures\CBTutorial.txt

The Tool is 100% Open and you can help fixing it if you want to, nobody forces you to use this tool and do not hate on the people you dont need to and on those doing it for free.")
